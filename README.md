# Yet Another New Tab Page

## Why does this exist?

I really don't like the new _New Tab Page_ in Chrome 28, and generally wanted something easier to scan than those useless website thumbnails and shrunken down buttons in a bookmark bar.

## What am I waiting for?

Good question! You should try it out!

## I found a problem!

I bet you did. I would prefer bug reports and feature requests be created through the GitHub Issues tracker.

## I have code I would like to contribute!

Send me a pull request!

## This extension sucks

If you don't like it, just go to _Menu > Tools > Extensions_ and uninstall it.
